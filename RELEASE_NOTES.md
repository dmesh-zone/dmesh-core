# 📓 Release Notes

All notable changes to the **Data Mesh SDK & CLI** will be documented in this file.

---

## 🚀 [v0.9.0] - 2026-06-15

### ✨ Highlights
This release consolidates the deployment strategy for Databricks Apps, migrates the default application port, and brings numerous stability and type-safety fixes to the SDK and CLI tools.

### ☁️ Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Consolidated Databricks Apps Deployment**: Added a new deployment script (`deploy-api-and-viewer-as-databricks-app.sh`) that automatically builds the `dmesh-viewer` UI and bundles it with the `dmesh-api` to be served by a single Databricks App. 

### ⚙️ SDK & Core Logic
- **JSON Schema Validation Robustness**: Addressed deprecation warnings for `jsonschema` and integrated the `referencing` library to properly handle schema validation dependencies and registries, resolving `ModuleNotFoundError` and `Validator` runtime errors.
- **Dependency Management**: Fixed missing package declarations by explicitly including `httpx` and `referencing` dependencies into the SDK requirements.

### 🖥️ CLI Enhancements & DX
- **CLI Setup Modules**: Resolved missing module import errors for `errors` and `feedback` during the CLI's `container_manager` initialization.
- **Type Safety**: Addressed type-incompatibility and attribute errors in the `list` and `put` SDK/CLI commands, ensuring optional arguments (like `domain`, `dp_name`) are properly cast to strings and properties are safely accessed.

## 🚀 [v0.8.0] - 2026-06-14

### ✨ Highlights
This major release introduces the **Filesystem Persistency** mode, allowing users to read data product and data contract data from the filestystem 

### 💾 Filesystem & Topology
- **Filesystem Persistency**: Added a fully functioning filesystem-backed repository implementation for Data Products and Data Contracts, managed via the `DMESH_SDK__FILESYSTEM_PERSISTENCY` configuration flag.
- **Configurable Topology**: Replaced hardcoded proxy logic with a unified and configurable topology setting in the SDK and CLI.

### 🖥️ CLI Enhancements & DX
- **Setup Command Flags**: Added convenient short flags `-r` (rest proxy) and `-t` (topology type) to the `dmesh setup` command.
- **Logging Visibility**: Improved logging by enabling configurable log levels, significantly reducing operational noise, and natively displaying the active persistency mode in the CLI upon startup.

### ☁️ Infrastructure & Security
- **REST SSL Verification**: Added support for SSL certificate verification (`DMESH_SDK__REST_PERSISTENCY_PROXY_SSL_VERIFY`) when operating the REST persistency proxy.
- **Proxy Environment Injection**: Proxy environment variables and build arguments are now transparently injected into all `docker-compose` services.

### ⚡ Performance & Stability
- **PostgreSQL Connection Pool Sizing**: Fine-tuned the connection pool size in `PostgresRepositoryFactory` to prevent starvation and improve throughput.
- **Database Indexing**: Added a database index to the `data_product_id` column in the `data_contracts` table to speed up lookup operations.

## 🚀 [v0.7.0] - 2026-06-10

### ✨ Highlights
This release introduces support for deploying the API with a Lakebase/Postgres database backend on Databricks Apps, along with usability improvements to the CLI testdata generation tool.

### 🖥️ CLI Enhancements & DX
- **Testdata Discovery & Convenience**: The `dmesh testdata` command's help text now automatically lists the default test specification files available out-of-the-box. Additionally, the `--file` argument now seamlessly resolves plain filenames against the default `testdata` directory without requiring full absolute paths.

### ☁️ Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Databricks Apps Dual-Backend Support**: Upgraded the automated Databricks deployment script (`deploy-api-as-databricks-app.sh`) to support multiple target environments (`mem` and `lakebase`).
- **Lakebase/Postgres Configurations**: Segmented the base `app.yaml` configuration into dedicated `app-mem.yaml` and `app-lakebase.yaml` manifests. The Lakebase manifest is configured to wire `postgres` as the `DB_TYPE` and inject database credentials directly from Databricks Apps secrets (e.g., `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, etc.).

## 🚀 [v0.6.1] - 2026-06-09

### ✨ Highlights
This release focuses on massive performance improvements and concurrency bug fixes for the SDK and CLI tools, particularly when interacting with remote Databricks Apps.

### ⚙️ SDK & Core Logic
- **HTTP Connection Pooling**: Refactored the HTTP REST proxy repository to utilize a single shared `httpx.AsyncClient` with custom limits (`max_keepalive_connections=20`, `max_connections=100`). This completely resolves "TCP connection exhaustion" errors during high-throughput workloads.

### 🖥️ CLI Enhancements & DX
- **Parallel Test Data Generation**: Overhauled the `dmesh testdata` command. It now uses asynchronous gathering and a concurrency semaphore (up to 20 concurrent requests) to parallelize Data Product, Contract creation. This results in a >10x speedup when inserting large mock workloads.
- **Type Safety**: Addressed type-safety and linting issues around SDK return signatures, guaranteeing safer ID extraction when interacting with the REST proxy.

## 🚀 [v0.6.0] - 2026-06-07

### ✨ Highlights
This release introduces configurable setup topologies, optional REST proxy persistency, and logging enhancements.

### ⚙️ SDK & Core Logic
- **REST proxy persistency**: Added support for REST as a persistency proxy, supporting local as well as Databricks apps using M2M authentication.
  - Requires setting `sdk.rest_persistency_proxy=true`, `sdk.rest_persistency_proxy_url`, and `sdk.rest_persistency_proxy_uses_databricks_m2m=true` (or their `DMESH_SDK__` environment variable equivalents), alongside standard Databricks credentials.
- **Business Name Propagation**: Propagate `dataProductBusinessName` in SDK 
- **Data Source Injection**: Data source technology injection using `dataSourceTechnology`.
- **Data Source Suppression**: Added `dataSourceSuppressed` data product config.

### 🏛️ Database & Schema Security
- **Schema Usage**: Fixed `dmesh` schema not being used. Database tables now under `dmesh` schema and `dp_version` no longer a column of `data_products`.

### 🛠️ Developer Experience (DX) & Chores
- **Logging**: Enhancements to logging.

## 🚀 [v0.5.0] - 2026-05-27

### ✨ Highlights
This release improves the SDK and CLI by introducing automatic propagation of data product business names, enhancing the `testdata` command's parsing capabilities, and streamlining local testing experiences for macOS developers.

### ⚙️ SDK & Core Logic
- **Business Name Propagation**: Automated the propagation of the `dataProductBusinessName` custom property when the system auto-generates a Data Source Data Product from a Source-Aligned Data Product (the auto-generated product gets the business name with a " data source" suffix).

### 🖥️ CLI Enhancements & DX
- **Robust Mermaid Parsing**: Improved the `dmesh testdata` command to correctly parse custom properties (like `dataProductBusinessName`) that contain spaces, while preserving their exact casing.

### 🛠️ Developer Experience (DX) & Testing
- **Colima Docker Socket Fallback**: Implemented an automated fallback in the test suite for macOS users running Colima, seamlessly detecting `~/.colima/default/docker.sock` and setting `TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE` to resolve Ryuk mount errors without requiring manual IDE run configuration.

## 🚀 [v0.4.0] - 2026-05-20

### ✨ Highlights
This release strengthens relational isolation at the database layer by enforcing strict schema-level routing, simplifies CLI fetching by completely deprecating legacy `dp_version` qualifiers, and introduces selective suppression controls for automated data source replication.

### 🏛️ Database & Schema Security
- **Enforced Session Schema Routing**: Configured default `search_path` options at the `psycopg` connection pool level and permanently altered database role search paths. Any unqualified queries or third-party connections now resolve cleanly to the `dmesh` schema, completely preventing table-level leakage to the `public` schema.
- **Unified Test Schema Defaults**: Upgraded all API and SDK integration test suite connection parameters to match session-level routing standards.

### ⚙️ SDK & Core Logic
- **Selective Data Source Suppression**: Introduced the `dataSourceSupressed` (and `dataSourceSuppressed`) custom property flag on source-aligned data products, giving developers the ability to cleanly opt-out of automated data source generation.

### 🖥️ CLI Enhancements & DX
- **Deprecation of legacy `dp_version`**: Fully purged `dp_version` parameters, options, and filters across `get`, `get_dc`, `put`, and `list` commands.
- **Refined Filename Formats**: Fetching commands now save configurations to clean, versionless filename layouts in the format `{domain}_{dp_name}_{dc_id}.yaml`.

## 🚀 [v0.3.0] - 2026-05-13

### ✨ Highlights
This release advances architectural maturity through automated data source creation, rigorous SQL namespace isolation, streamlined schema configuration, and a fast-path performance testing suite.

### ⚙️ SDK & Core Logic
- Automated Data Source Generation: Introduced auto-creation of "Data Source Data Product" whenever a new "Source-Aligned Data Product" is registered (leveraging the `dataSourceTechnology` spec property).
Database Schema Unification: Completely eliminated the redundant embedded SQL string literal. Python's persistency layer now loads the single SQL source of truth (init.sql) dynamically at runtime.
- **Database Schema Unification**: Completely eliminated the redundant embedded SQL string literal. Python's persistency layer now loads the single SQL source of truth (`init.sql`) dynamically at runtime.
- **Schema Consolidation**: Cleaned up legacy database structures by removing the redundant `dp_version` column from the physical `data_products` table (with version supported only inside specification JSONB column)

### 🏛️ Infrastructure & Security
- **Isolated SQL Namespaces**: Migrated all database persistence and integration test suites into a dedicated Postgres `dmesh` schema, enabling clean multi-tenant hosting and stricter access controls.
- **Consolidated Docker Setup**: Streamlined Docker layouts by removing duplicate DB initialization folders in the API module in favor of a shared volume pointing to the core SDK asset.

### 🛠️ Developer Experience (DX)
- **Opt-in Performance Testing**: Heavy performance testing suites (`test_sdk_performance.py`) are now **skipped by default** using global pytest hooks. High-scale runs can be toggled via a new `--run-perf` CLI argument.
- **Global Testing Configuration**: Promoted performance testing and external database CLI flags to the root test fixtures for global execution flexibility.

## 🚀 [v0.2.0] - 2026-05-04

### ✨ Highlights
This release introduces significant enhancements to the CLI experience, SDK extensibility via custom ID hooks, and advanced discovery capabilities.

### 🖥️ CLI Enhancements
- **Interactive Mode**: Introduced `-i` / `--interactive` flag, launching a REPL environment with command history support for seamless mesh management.
- **Visual Spec Generation**: Added `dmesh testdata` command to instantly generate mesh components from [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) specifications.
- **Environment Management**: Added `dmesh clean` to quickly reset the local environment by truncating data product and contract tables.

### ⚙️ SDK & Core Logic
- **Extensible ID Generation**: Introduced `id_generator_hook`. Developers can now provide custom interfaces for `make_dp_id` and `make_dc_id`, working directly off the specification dictionaries.
- **Smart Enrichment**:
    - **Port Adapter Expansion**: Automatically populates new ports (e.g., OData) with `adaptedFrom` metadata.
    - **Contract Auto-linking**: Automatically links `contractId` and `contractVersion` during the enrichment phase.
- **Multi-Contract Support**: New `sdk.singleDataContractPerProduct` configuration (defaults to `True`) to control contract cardinality per product.
- **Deep Patching**: Enhanced `patch_data_product` to support selective updates within `customProperties` without overwriting existing metadata.

### 🔍 Discovery & Integration
- **Unified Discover API**: New `GET /discover` endpoint in the API and corresponding SDK methods for domain and name-based filtering.
- **Metadata Transformation**: SDK now automatically converts `dataUsageAgreements` custom properties into structured specification objects upon discovery.
- **UUID Standardization**: Internally migrated `data_products` and `data_contracts` keys to standard UUID types for better interoperability.

### 🛠️ Configuration & DX
- **Smart Defaults**: Added `DMESH_SDK__DATA_PRODUCT_STATUS_DEFAULT` and `DMESH_SDK__DATA_CONTRACT_STATUS_DEFAULT` (both defaulting to `active`).
- **Test Hardening**: Standardized ID assertions across the test suite and added comprehensive SDK client lifecycle tests.
